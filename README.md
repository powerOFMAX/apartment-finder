# React Apartment Finder

This is a simple apartment finder built using ReactJS, Redux and Styled Components.

## Things to know:
Given that this sample was build for front-end purposes this will not include a back-end connection. Instead, we are grabbing some fake values from a .js file located on "src/app/config/" folder. This also means that the filter by direction functionality is not going to make a request, we are filtering those fields using Javascript.

## Requirements
This app was built using create-react-app so the requirements are the same.

- Node >= 8.10

## How to set up the project
The basic steps to set up the project are:
- Clone the repo
- Open the folder
- Run ```npm install```
- Run ```npm start```

This project also has ESlint configured so, you have two more scripts that you can use:
- ```npm run lint```
- ```npm run lint:fix```

If you need more specific steps, follow the next ones.

First, clone the repository or download it as a zip. To clone use this command:

```

Go to the main folder using  ```cd apartment-finder/```

Open the terminal on that folder and run
```
  npm install
```
Once its done, run ```npm start``` and you should be able to see the project up and running on ```http://localhost:3000/```
